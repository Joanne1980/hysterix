### MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Hysterix, identifying and labelling my:

- **Must Haves**: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.
  
- **Should Haves**: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
- **Could Haves**: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.
- **Won't Haves**: the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.

# Deployment
  
## Connecting to GitHub  

To begin this project from scratch, you must first create a new GitHub repository using the [Code Institute's Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). This template provides the relevant tools to get you started. To use this template:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or create a new account.
2. Navigate to the above CI Full Template.
3. Click '**Use this template**' -> '**Create a new repository**'.
4. Choose a new repository name and click '**Create repository from template**'.
5. In your new repository space, click the purple CodeAnywhere (if this is your IDE of choice) button to generate a new workspace.

## Django Project Setup

1. Install Django and supporting libraries: 
   
- ```pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn```
- ```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```
- ```pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage```  
  
2. Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a **requirements.txt** file and add all installed libraries to it with the ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` command in the terminal.  
3. Create a new Django project in the terminal ```django-admin startproject freefido .```
4. Create a new app eg. ```python3 mangage.py startapp booking```
5. Add this to list of **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** - 'booking',
6. Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
7. Migrate the changes with commands: ```python3 manage.py migrate```
8. An **env.py** file must be created to store all protected data such as the **DATABASE_URL** and **SECRET_KEY**. These may be called upon in your project's **settings.py** file along with your Database configurations. The **env.py** file must be added to your **gitignore** file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. For adding to **env.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURLfromElephantSQL>"```
- ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"```
  
For adding to **settings.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```import dj_database_url```
- ```if os.path.exists("env.py"):```
- ```import env```
- ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')``` (actual key hidden within env.py)  

9. Replace **DATABASES** with:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

10. Set up the templates directory in **settings.py**:
- Under ``BASE_DIR`` enter ``TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘templates’)``
- Update ``TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`` with:

```
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')
```

- Create the media, static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.

11. A **Procfile** must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: ```web: gunicorn freefido.wsgi```
12. Make the necessary migrations again.

## Cloudinary API 

Cloudinary provides a cloud hosting solution for media storage. All users uploaded images in the FreeFid project are hosted here.

Set up a new account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your **env.py** and Heroku Config Vars.
In your project workspace: 

- Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 
- In the order: 
```
   'cloudinary_storage',  
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
   'cloudinary',
```
- Add to **env.py** and link up with **settings.py**: ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://...."``` 
- Set Cloudinary as storage for media and static files in settings.py:
- ```STATIC_URL = '/static/'```
```
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'  
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]  
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')‌  
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

## Elephant SQL

A new database instance can be created on [Elephant SQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) for your project. 

- Choose a name and select the **Tiny Turtle** plan, which is free.
- Select your Region and the nearest Data Center to you. 
- From your user dashboard, retrieve the important 'postgres://....' value. Place the value within your **DATABASE_URL**  in your **env.py** file and follow the below instructions to place it in your Heroku Config Vars.


## Heroku deployment

To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account if you are a new user.
2. Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the '**New**' button in the top, right corner, and select '**Create New App**'.
3. Enter an app name and choose your region. Click '**Create App**'. 
4. In the Deploy tab, click on the '**Settings**', reach the '**Config Vars**' section and click on '**Reveal Config Vars**'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your: 
   
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL**: **cloudinary://....** 
   - **DATABASE_URL**:**postgres://...** 
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),
   -  **PORT**:**8000**
   -  **SECRET_KEY** and value  
  
5. Add the Heroku host name into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in your projects **settings.py file** -> ```['herokuappname', ‘localhost’, ‘8000 port url’].```
6. Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that **DEBUG=False**, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.
7. Go to the '**Deploy**' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.
8. Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the '**Connect**' button.
9.  Choose from '**Automatic**' or '**Manual**' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click '**Deploy Branch**'.
10. Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the '**View**' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC**  may be removed from the Config Vars once you have saved and pushed an image within your project, as can **PORT:8000**.

## Clone project

A local clone of this repository can be made on GitHub. Please follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to GitHub and log in.
2. The [FreeFido Repository](https://github.com/amylour/FreeFido_v2) can be found at this location.
3. Above the repository file section, locate the '**Code**' button.
4. Click on this button and choose your clone method from HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI, copy the URL to your clipboard by clicking the '**Copy**' button.
5. Open your Git Bash Terminal.
6. Change the current working directory to the location you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type `git clone` and paste in the copied URL from step 4.
8. Press '**Enter**' for the local clone to be created.
9. Using the ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` command, the dependencies and libraries needed for FreeFido will be installed.
10. Set up your **env.py** file and from the above steps for Cloudinary and ElephantSQL, gather the Cloudinary API key and the Elephant SQL url for additon to your code.
11. Ensure that your **env.py** file is placed in your **.gitignore** file and follow the remaining steps in the above Django Project Setup section before pushing your code to GitHub.

## Fork Project

A copy of the original repository can be made through GitHub. Please follow the below steps to fork this repository:
